sdesc: "GTK+ MP3/Ogg file splitter"
ldesc: "Mp3splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files 
selecting a begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's very 
useful to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire 
albums to obtain original tracks. If you want to split an album, you can 
select split points and filenames manually or you can get them 
automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue files."
